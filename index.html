        <p>
            My name is Vignesh Ram. I study in Chilwell Primary School in Australia. I am 10 years old. My birthday is on the 5th of February. I was born in the United States of America in 2011. My hobbies and talents are playing cricket, riding my bike, reading books, listening to music, solving math problems and programming. In cricket, I play for the U13s at the age of 10 (started playing when I was 9) but unfortunately, we lost the semi-final by 1 run last week. I also got selected for the inter-school Lightning Premiership competition for cricket. For cycling, I ride my bike to and fro to school every day. That helps keeping fit and gives me a bit of exercise. P.S. I also like riding my bike. I always like to spend the time out by reading novels and listening to the radio whenever I have time. I am a great fan of maths because I always love solving problems and exercising my brain for challenges. In coding, I am a junior app developer. I started learning to code only a few months back and due to the courage from WhiteHatJr, I have also thoroughly enjoyed that.
